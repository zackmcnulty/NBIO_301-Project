# NBIO 301 Final Project

Welcome to our final project for Introduction to Neuroscience. This class 
focuses on the electrical activity at synapses including the role
neurotransmitters play in signaling, the influences of ion permeability on
electrical activity, the effect various channels can on membrane potential, 
and the ways in which populations of neurons can interact and modulate their
overal behavior.
