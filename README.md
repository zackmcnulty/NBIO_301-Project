# NBIO 301 Final Project

Welcome to our final project for Introduction to Neuroscience. This class 
focuses on the electrical activity at synapses including the role
neurotransmitters play in signaling, the influences of ion permeability on
electrical activity, the effect various channels can on membrane potential, 
and the ways in which populations of neurons can interact and modulate their
overal behavior.


Basic git workflow

- Change into the project's directory/folder. Use ls to see files in directory and cd DIRECTORY to change folders

##### get changes from other people: ALWAYS do this before you start working
- git pull

##### submit your own changes: ALWAYS do this when you are done working
- git add FILENAME
- git commit -m "summary of what you did"
